                <h2>What are the best Mountain Dew flavors?</h2>
                <p><img src="41grWcapUML.jpg" alt="Picture of Baja Blast and VooDew"></p>
                <p>The best Mountain Dew flavors are Baja Blast and VooDew. Baja Blast is a tropical lime spin on the original flavor and packs a delicious punch. <br> 
                The exclusivity of Baja Blast helps further the greatness because being only able to drink it at Taco Bell and summertime availability adds to the drinking experience. <br>
                Baja Blast is known by many as the best Mountain Dew flavor, maybe even the pinnacle of pops, but there is one more contender that puts up a serious fight. <br>
                That underdog and often overlooked contender is Mountain Dew VooDew! I love the name and aesthetic for this can, full of cool ghosts and wisping colors. <br>
                VooDew is also a limited time beverage, being only available during Halloween and being marked as a "mystery flavor" adds to the spooky experience that Mountain Dew was trying to go for. <br>
                VooDew is a great example of a holiday beverage because it encapsulates what the holiday is all about while offering a new experience to veteran Dew drinkers. <br>
                VooDew is the most recent flavor Mountain Dew has released, which means they are improving their flavor repertoire substantially! <br> This makes me excited for
                future flavors and gives me hope for Mountain Dew's future. </p>

                <h2>What is the worst Mountain Dew flavor</h2>
                <p><img src="81KT+OIpW3L._SL1500_.jpg" alt="A picture of Mountian Dew Code Red"></p>
                <p>For me, the worst Mountain Dew flavor is without a doubt Code Red. Mountain Dew Code Red is a cherry flavored spin on the original flavor and it is not pleasant at all. <br>
                This flavor reminds me of drinking cough medicine, with its harsh and overpowering artificial cherry flavoring making the drink almost unbearable. The first time I tried the beverage <br>
                I had high hopes but was severely disappointed. My roommate loves this flavor, but I and many others cannot stand this flavor and will drink any other Mountain Dew flavors available in <br> stores.
                A part of me doesn't understand why it is so popular, almost always available on the Meijer shelves when the superior flavors are missing, but my theory is that they have been there so long that <br>
                all customers overlook the cherry flavored Dew in pursuit of better flavors. My second runner up to Code Red for worst flavor is Pitch Black, with a harsh and <br> 
                processed grape flavor overpowering the Dew taste entirely. The can is aesthetically pleasing and the beverage is leagues above Code Red in taste and an original take on presentation. The original Mountain Dew is far tastier than Code Red could ever be.</p>
